Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.

It occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. The process requires sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.

The main products of photosynthesis are glucose and oxygen. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere.

Photosynthesis is essential for life on Earth as it provides oxygen and is the basis of most food chains.
